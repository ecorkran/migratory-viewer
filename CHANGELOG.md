## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.4] - 20260424

### Added (slice 112 — Terrain Wire Protocol v2)
- Per-connection terrain assembler at [src/protocol/terrain-assembler.ts](src/protocol/terrain-assembler.ts) implementing the v2 wire-protocol state machine: `IDLE` ↔ `EXPECTING_CHUNKS`, with strict ordering enforcement (SNAPSHOT first, all terrain before STATE_UPDATE).
- v2 single-shot `TERRAIN` (`0x03`) and chunked `TERRAIN_HEADER` (`0x05`) + `TERRAIN_CHUNK` (`0x04`) decode paths supporting all nine dtype × compression combinations (`f32` / `f64` / `uint16` × `none` / `zstd` / `lz4`). For `uint16` payloads, dequantization is `min + (u16 / 65535) * (max - min)` with a constant-terrain (`min == max`) special case to avoid NaN.
- Decompression dispatcher at [src/protocol/decompress.ts](src/protocol/decompress.ts) wrapping `fzstd` (zstd RFC 8478 frames) and `lz4js` (LZ4 Frame format). `none` returns the input unchanged; decoder failures are wrapped in a `TypeError` prefixed `terrain decompress: <algorithm> failed: …`.
- `TERRAIN_CHUNK = 0x04` and `TERRAIN_HEADER = 0x05` opcodes added to `MessageType`; new `TerrainDtype` and `TerrainCompression` const-as-object tables.
- Tier-2 protocol-error policy for terrain opcodes — reserved-bit set, unknown dtype/compression, out-of-state chunk, missing/duplicate/overlapping chunks, decoder failure, and length mismatches all close the WebSocket with code 1002 rather than the slice-101 log-and-skip pattern. SNAPSHOT and STATE_UPDATE retain their tier-1 (log + drop) behavior.
- Per-terrain-transfer INFO log line: `[net] TERRAIN rows=R cols=C resolution=X dtype=DT compression=COMP chunks=N bytes_compressed=BC bytes_decompressed=BD`.
- 50 new unit tests across `types.test.ts`, `decompress.test.ts`, `terrain-assembler.test.ts`, `terrain-assembler-chunked.test.ts`, and additions to `connection.test.ts`. Includes the spec's exact 2×2 worked example (single-shot) and 4×2 worked example (chunked) as ground-truth byte sequences.

### Changed (slice 112)
- [src/net/connection.ts](src/net/connection.ts) `handleMessage` now routes through a per-`connect()` assembler instance: `assembler.feed(buffer)` returns a discriminated union (`message` | `pending` | `protocol-error`); on `protocol-error` the WebSocket closes with code 1002 and the existing reconnect-with-backoff path runs. Per-connection assembler creation guarantees no chunked-state leak across reconnects.
- [src/protocol/deserialize.ts](src/protocol/deserialize.ts) `parseMessage` no longer dispatches on `TERRAIN` (`0x03`); terrain decode is now exclusively assembler-routed. The slice 102 v1 single-shot terrain parser and its test suite have been removed (replaced by v2 tests with full byte-layout coverage).

### Dependencies (slice 112)
- Added `fzstd@0.1.1` (~10 KB pure-JS zstd decoder).
- Added `lz4js@0.2.0` (~30 KB pure-JS LZ4 Frame decoder). Server-side LZ4 frames must be emitted with `content_size=False` and `content_checksum=False` (descriptor `0x60` family) — `lz4js` v0.2.0 has a bit-shift bug in its content-size handling. Constraint documented in [project-documents/reference/terrain-wire-protocol-v2.md](project-documents/reference/terrain-wire-protocol-v2.md).
- Bundle delta vs slice 111 (tag `v0.0.3`): +19 KB raw / +7.5 KB gzipped. Within TD-4's 20 KB-gzipped target.

## [0.7.0] - 20260424
### Added
- Geological slab beneath the terrain — four side walls tracking the terrain edge elevation profile plus a bottom face, unified with the top surface as a single closed indexed `BufferGeometry` in `terrain.ts`. Walls render as pure cliff appearance via the existing slope-blend (`normalWorld.y ≈ 0` resolves below `slopeBlendLow`).
- `slabDepth` field in `ViewerConfig` — depth of the slab below the lowest terrain point in world units (default `100`).
- Triplanar diffuse texture sampling on terrain top and walls via TSL `triplanarTexture(texture(map), null, null, scaleNode)`. World-space projection eliminates UV seams on slopes; no per-frame CPU cost.
- Tangent-space normal maps blended with the same slope factor and wrapped once with `normalMap()` (avoids `NormalMapNode` / `vec3` typing mismatch in `mix()`).
- `BiomeConfig` extended with optional `surfaceTexturePath`, `cliffTexturePath`, `surfaceNormalPath`, `cliffNormalPath` plus required `textureScale` and `cliffTextureScale` (independent tiling density for vegetation vs. rock).
- `TerrainMaterialHandle.updateBiome()` now detects texture-path changes and rebuilds the material (disposing the old one); uniform-only updates preserve the material reference. Single-method contract preserved per the slice design.
- 2K CC0 PBR textures shipped under `public/textures/biomes/default/` (surface + cliff diffuse and normal maps).

### Changed
- `applyTerrainToMesh` and `applyFlatPlane` now build a closed unified mesh (top + 4 walls + bottom) instead of just a top-surface plane. Vertex layout preserves the slice 110 invariant: first `rows*cols` vertices are the top surface in row-major order.
- `applyFlatPlane` no longer renders a literal flat plane — it builds a flat-topped slab with the same wall/bottom geometry as the TERRAIN path, for a consistent silhouette before terrain data arrives.

### Removed
- `src/rendering/slab.ts` and `src/rendering/slab.test.ts` (initial design proposed a separate slab module; mid-implementation revision unified everything into `terrain.ts` for guaranteed gap-free seams between top and walls).

## [0.6.0] - 20260422
### Added
- `BiomeConfig` interface in `config.ts` — PBR biome appearance parameters (surface/cliff colors, roughness, metalness, slope blend thresholds)
- `DEFAULT_BIOME` constant: alien vegetation preset matching the concept art reference
- `TerrainMaterialHandle` interface and `createTerrainMaterial(biome)` in `terrain.ts` — TSL slope-blend node graph on `MeshStandardNodeMaterial`; runtime biome switching via `updateBiome()` with no shader recompile
- `getTerrainMaterialHandle()` export for developer console access to `updateBiome`
- `renderer.debug.checkShaderErrors = true` in dev mode via `import.meta.env.DEV` guard

### Changed
- Terrain mesh material upgraded from `MeshLambertMaterial` to `MeshStandardNodeMaterial` with TSL slope-blend shader
- Lighting upgraded to alien-world aesthetic: deep blue-purple hemisphere sky (`0x1a1a4e`), near-black green ground bounce (`0x0a1a0a`), warm amber key light (`0xfff5d0`, `Math.PI * 1.5` intensity) from upper-left angle
- `groundColor` removed from `ViewerConfig`; surface color is now `biomeConfig.surfaceColor`

## [0.5.0] - 20260418
### Added
- Terrain rendering from TERRAIN (0x03) wire message (migratory slice 507): displaced `PlaneGeometry` with bilinear-interpolated elevation grid
- `getTerrainHeight(grid, x, z)` — bilinear interpolation with edge clamping; used for entity y-placement
- Entity cones now rest on terrain surface via `getTerrainHeight`; configurable vertical offset via `entityVerticalOffsetRatio`
- `terrainMaxCells` config cap (default 4 M cells) mirrors server's 32 MiB reasoning
- Flat-plane fallback (`applyFlatPlane`) preserves pre-slice-102 behavior when server omits TERRAIN
- `TerrainGrid` state field + `terrainRevision` counter drive incremental mesh rebuilds in render loop

## [0.4.1] - 20260410
### Added
- TPS (ticks per second) counter in HUD — measures actual server tick rate received over a 1-second rolling window, distinguishing simulation update rate from render FPS

## [0.4.0] - 20260410
### Added
- HUD overlay panel (`src/ui/hud.ts`, `src/ui/hud.css`) displaying connection status, tick counter, entity count, FPS, and profile legend with color swatches
- Connection status indicator with colored dot (green/yellow/red) and pulsing animation for reconnecting state
- FPS counter with exponential moving average smoothing
- Profile legend with per-profile entity counts and color swatches from `config.profileColors`
- `H` key toggles HUD visibility; click-through (`pointer-events: none`) preserves canvas interaction
- HUD updates before the render early-return, showing connection status while awaiting first snapshot

## [0.3.0] - 20260409
### Added
- World-bounds clamping: pan edges cannot cross world bounds, zoom-out capped at world-fit (zoom=1, full world height visible)
- `panStart`, `panMove`, `panEnd`, `zoomBy` action API exported from `camera.ts`
- `clampCameraToWorld` internal helper enforces position constraints after every camera mutation
- `config.allowOutOfBoundsView` debug flag disables zoom and pan clamps
- `src/input/camera-input.ts` module owns all DOM event binding for the camera

### Changed
- Pan input changed from middle/right-click to left-click drag
- `camera.ts` is now DOM-free — contains no `addEventListener` calls
- `handleResize` re-evaluates zoom-fit and clamps camera position after window resize

## [0.2.0] - 20260406
### Added
- Binary wire protocol deserializer for SNAPSHOT (0x01) and STATE_UPDATE (0x02) messages with little-endian discipline and parse-boundary validation (`src/protocol/`)
- `ViewerState` singleton with `applySnapshot` / `applyStateUpdate` mutation helpers — connection manager is the sole writer (`src/state.ts`)
- WebSocket connection manager with state machine (DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING → CONNECTED → RECONNECTING), exponential backoff with jitter (500ms → 30s cap), and forced reconnect on entity-count mismatch (`src/net/connection.ts`)
- Live entity rendering: `entities.ts` now consumes `ViewerState`, allocates `InstancedMesh` at `config.maxEntityCount` capacity, and refreshes profile colors only on snapshot
- `config.maxEntityCount` (default 200,000) — hard cap enforced by the parser
- vitest test runner with 29 unit tests covering deserialize, state mutations, connection lifecycle, and entity update logic

### Changed
- `entities.ts` no longer generates random test data; entity rendering is driven entirely by server snapshots
- `main.ts` wires `createConnection(viewerState)` and calls `updateEntities(mesh, viewerState)` per frame

## [0.1.0] - 20260406
### Added
- Vite + TypeScript project scaffold with pnpm
- Three.js WebGPURenderer with automatic WebGL 2 fallback (via `three/webgpu`)
- Orthographic top-down camera with mouse wheel zoom and right-click drag pan
- Flat ground plane terrain sized to world bounds (1000x1000)
- InstancedMesh rendering of 500 test entities (cones) with profile-based coloring
- Physically correct lighting (HemisphereLight + DirectionalLight)
- Render loop via `renderer.setAnimationLoop()` with `THREE.Timer`
- GPU device loss handling for both WebGPU and WebGL 2 fallback paths
- Centralized configuration module (`config.ts`) with typed defaults
- Console logging of active renderer backend (WebGPU vs WebGL 2)
